Blue Chairs

These blue chairs
sit here
while snowey winds whip
and moonlit tulips bloom.

I don't recall
ever sitting in one--
they scare me.

The storekeep will come out
and ask your name
while they caht jovially wiht you.

The worst part of it,
though,
is that they'll remember
your name when you come back.

And they'll ask how you've been--
but you wouldn't want to
disappoint anyone
with your truth.

So you lie.
