Listen!

Can you hear that wailing
noise?
It haunts me!

I look to the streets,
to see if others
hear it too.

But they never let on
that they hear it.

They have to hear it!
I hear it more clearly
than my own heartbeat,

it shakes the thin walls
and howls through
the hollow fireplace.

I hear it so
loudly that I begin
to see it in the air--

like a dark wave
puring over
me.

Slowly smoothing out 
the edges and
buffing the blemishes.

Some days
I can almost feel
it happening.

And today
my ears
are filled with water.
