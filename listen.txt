Listen!

Can you hear that wailing
noise?
It haunts me!

I look to the streets,
to see if the others
hear it too.

But they never let on
that they might.

They have to hear it!
I hear it more clearly
than my own heartbeat--

it shakes the thin walls
and howls through
the hollow fireplace.

I hear it so
loudly that I begin
to see it in the air.

Like a dark wave
puring over
me,

slowly smoothing out 
my edges and
buffing the blemishes.

Some days
I can almost feel
it happening,
the fixing, that is.

And today
my ears
are filled with water.
