Snow

I know I have places to be, but I've never seen snow
so perfect. Reflecting the moon's ivory light onto the
crystalline trees and their still needles. Even on
my best days I've only entertained the trees
with a sprinkling of light from my
camera's flash. So it seems unfair
that I should let my
heavy step interrupt this recital of
the moon to this woodland audience.
