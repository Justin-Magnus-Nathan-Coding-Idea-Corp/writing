Dancers in the Dark

In the dark, they dance as if a waltz is
playing that no one has heard before. One so 
beautiful as to make the stone marble foors upon
which they dance feel velveteen and the room
around only enough, fit for two.

They dance for your words that sweep through
the air around me when I notice the color of
your eyes in Water Lilies and in the shifting shapes
out the window.

They dance for the way I cannot sit down to write
without your laughter swelling through my pen and
landing on the paper,
	even in poems I've written with blue ink.

but mostly, I think,

they dance for you.

-For my most Dearest Ellen
