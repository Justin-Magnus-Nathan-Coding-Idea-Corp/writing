Interlude


Silver space surrounds
My ears–these noise cancelling
Headphones that I bought brand new
Keep me safe.


A song that sings
To ears and eyes
So close, but far
From lips of those
Who wrote the words.


“The chrome color suits you,
It matches your olive undertones.”


A song that sings
through nods and news
To me, I miss
Some grins and laughs
I don’t much mind.


Miles and Monk mend
The gaps gingerly–
Between my mind
And the whorled world.


But seldom something
Slips through, my mom:
“I love you so”


A song that sings
To ears and eyes
So close, but far
From lips of those
Who wrote the words.
