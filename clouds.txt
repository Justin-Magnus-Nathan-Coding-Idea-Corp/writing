clouds

Shaping the days of sleepless dreamers,
these nomads drift endlessly
behind my eyes and in the skies.

They slip through my skull
in the night
unknown, silent in their path.

I can feel them
pulling me apart,
tearing me into pieces.

These days, they land like a stale fog
pulling at me. 
Pulling at me until,

I, too,
am no more than a transparent haze--

moving with their pull,
sitting amongst their whole,
awaiting some final cull.
To feel a pull
out of this nightmarish lull.

To feel days
that fall over themselves
to reach me
and hurry me along,
as I grasp at their edges.

That's what I see in the sky.
