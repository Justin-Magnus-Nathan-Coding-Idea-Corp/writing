fire

A fire must've started burning
across the land, far away
while I slept

silent and violent and
turning all to smoke
with its touch.

I awoke to
its ash covering
the land and sea.

Most seemed unbothered
walking along with
a path clearing behind.

But my hands and feet
seemed to be coverd
by the thick soot--

carrying the ash
that I touched
outside

to the tables
and chairs and
walls in my home.

I didn't notice
until that night
that allwas clean,

the dark ash
had gone
from my home and
from the streets.

Yet, whe I looked
to my wrinkled and worn hands,
the ash remained.
