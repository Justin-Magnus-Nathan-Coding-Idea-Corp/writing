Peach Fuzz

Covered in the fuzz of peaches
from a long day at the orchard
in between the sweet smelling trees.

I didn't pick many
but their juice stains my hands--
sticky and strange.

Evidence from my trip
washes down the drain
with the cold bath water,

disappeared in the maze
of pipes running
under the city.
