A Meeting with the Devil

I always liked the idea of
a deal with the devil. To trade
a part of yourself for something
unattainable. It's just 
unnerving to find out I've been
living the consequences of one
 I hadn't known I'd made. To
have these perspectives in
trade for the years of my life I
know I won't see. I don't 
remember meeting them, the 
devil, that is, but I'm sure they
knew more than me. I don't regret it-- 
I like how I've turned out. I 
just wish I could remember the
moment.
