silhouette

It's raining, as I sit her watching
shadows flaot past in the dark.

Only the thin silhouette of being
to separate them from the cashmere
night--

yet, they all seem so unbothered
by the frailty of that distiction.
Too busy being everyone and doing
everything to feel this margin of
the living.

I've never had that ability.

I can feel the droplets roll over 
my edges to blur my shape, feeling
the split seconds when my body
is lost.
