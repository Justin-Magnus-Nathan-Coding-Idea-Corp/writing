Fritz

I've never felt a howling wind like this. One
whose edges grin between their
melodies of men who have tried and failed to
slip past its guard. One whose icy chill washes
over your warm fluids as you lay there--
draining. On your back as its gray hands hold
you still while it smiles through its glassy
eyes into your own.
"Lay here. Stay still. Watch."
It howls through you. You comply, not 
because you don't know any better, but 
because you do. And you still want to.
